<h2>DATA SCIENCE BY MASRUL MOLLAH</h2>
<p>Data science is the study of data. It involves developing methods of recording, storing, and analyzing data to effectively extract useful information. The goal of data science is to gain insights and knowledge from any type of data — both structured and unstructured.</p>
<p>These insights help the companies to make powerful data-driven decisions. Data Science requires the usage of both unstructured and structured data.</p>
<p>This course has been designed to give details understanding about data science, its future, usaes, tools used for data science and how to become data scientiest</p>

<div id="WHAT IS DATA SCIENCE" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>WHAT IS DATA SCIENCE</h3>
  <p>Algorithms have a long history and the word can be traced back to the 9th century. At this time the Persian scientist, astronomer and mathematician Abdullah Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi, often cited as “The father of Algebra”, was indirect responsible for the creation of the term “Algorithm”.</p>

<div id="WHAT IS ALGORITHOM" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>WHAT IS ALGORITHOM</h3>
  <p>An algorithm (pronounced AL-go-rith-um) is a procedure or formula for solving a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions. A computer program can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm. In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm usually means a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem.</p>

<div id="HOW ALGORITHOM WORKS" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>HOW ALGORITHOM WORKS</h3>
  <p>An algorithm, for the non-programmers among us, is a set of instructions that take an input, A, and provide an output, B, that changes the data involved in some way. Algorithms have a wide variety of applications. In math, they can help calculate functions from points in a data set, among much more advanced things.</p>
